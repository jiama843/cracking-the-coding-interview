# Types of problems

# Bottom-up
# Figure out how to solve simple cases and build a solution from it

# Top-Down
# Divide problem into N sub problems (careful of overlap)

# Half-and-Half
# Split structure into 2 halves and recurse on both (e.g mergesort)

# Iterative vs Recursive (All recursive problems can be solved iteratively)
# Good to say but for the sake of "readibility" to use recursion
